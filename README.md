# EnumerateDevicesAndVolumesWin
An algorithm to enumerate devices, storage volumes and volumes is described. Prototype JS-code which implements this
algorithm runs faster then Windows utility when executing the same task. Full description in Russian is given in the 
EnumerateDevicesAndVolumes.docx, EnumerateDevicesAndVolumes.docx. An english version will be provided in the nearest future: 
it really exists but needs to be changed according with a changes of the algorithm during last two weeks.
EnumerateVolumes.LLD.docx and EnumerateVolumes.LLD.pdf were updated. 
August 24, 2015. New version of StdRegWrapperClass is implemented. No changes in the Enumeration class code or testing code.
StdRegWrapperClass with some test-cases was placed into StdRegWrapperClass branch.
